&iRock Bottom was inspired by amazing
&igames like Minecraft, Terraria and
&iStardew Valley.
&iI believe that video games are an
&iawesome way of bringing people together
&ito create something amazing.
&iRock Bottom wasn't created with the
&iintent to be "just another sandbox game",
&ibut to create a great community of
&iplayers, modders and content creators
&ithat have fun with what they do.
&iI hope that you enjoy playing the game
&ias much as we enjoy working on it.
